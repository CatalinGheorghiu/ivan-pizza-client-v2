              bachelor&apos;s degrees in economics and physics. He moved to
              California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided

              Ivan has been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or
              unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018,
              he was sued for defamation by a diver who advised in the Tham
              Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled in favor of Ivan. Also
              in 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued
              him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private
              takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping
              down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his
              Twitter usage. Ivan has received criticism for his views on such
              matters as artificial intelligence and the COVID-19 pandemic.
